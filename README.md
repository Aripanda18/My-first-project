# My-first-project

A project from my Developer Class showing the beginning of Javascript Methods. 

In this example we were to use the "Prompt", "Alert" and "Console.log" methods to show how they all work together as well as in a project setting. 

The user will be prompted to answer questions about themselves and depending on the answer provided, an alert will be given to represent a "Stalkerish" experience based on the answer.
